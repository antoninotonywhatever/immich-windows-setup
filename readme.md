[For configuring Immich ](https://github.com/immich-app/immich) on a Windows computer that you use for other things. This repo contains compose, env, and other files + notes. I put this together because I had to hop between multiple sources of documentation, blogs, etc and that was annoying. 

Background / Motivations:
- I'm a photographer and have been for 10+ years
- I have well over 300K photos spread across multiple drives
- Searching them sucks. Windows search is famously bad. Lightroom cries / isn't performant, even on a device with 128GB of ram and a Ryzen 9 processor.
- I don't want to upload them to Google Photos, iCloud, something similar. I want to maintain some amount of privacy and my workflows are already local. 
- I'm jealous of the Object and Face detection that iOS has - being able to search for a location, date, object, or person is really nice. 


Prerequisites:
- WSL and Docker Desktop installed + configured
- Probably some other things I'm forgetting
